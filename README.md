# Hi, I'm Felipe de Leon

Senior Software Engineer at `Xmartlabs`, focused on mobile platforms, backend systems, and applied formal verification.

## About

- Senior Software Engineer at `Xmartlabs`, building and shipping production software since `2018`
- Computer Engineering graduate, Universidad de la Republica (Udelar), completed in `2024`
- Research Assistant (Udelar), formal verification project, `2023-2025`
- Conference presenter and co-author at `VSTTE 2025`

## What I Work On

- Cross-platform mobile apps (`Android`, `Flutter`)
- Backend services (`Node.js`, `FastAPI`, `Supabase`)
- Hardware/software integrations (`BLE`, POS devices, printers)
- Real-time features (`WebSocket`, push-driven workflows)
- Mobile and browser ML integrations (`TensorFlow Lite`)

## Selected Work

### Product Engineering (client projects)

- Built and maintained production mobile applications for healthcare, hiring, and wearable-integrated products.
- Implemented BLE communication and YMODEM file transfer for real-time interaction with wearable devices.
- Delivered backend improvements including auth flows, chat-related APIs, schema migration strategies (`ORM + Alembic`), and observability setup (`Langfuse`).
- Implemented Supabase `RLS` and `Edge Functions` for secure business-rule enforcement.
- Built mobile ML experiences with `TensorFlow Lite`, camera pipelines, and performance-oriented asynchronous processing.

### Cobraticket (`2023 - 2024`, Contractor)

- Implemented cashless payments with `MIFARE Classic` cards on POS devices (`Symcode`, `Z93`).
- Added receipt printing with `ESC/POS`, driver-level integration, and printer protocol handling.
- Implemented laser-printer sticker workflows for event operations in a separate app.

### Formal Verification Research (`09/2023 - 09/2025`, Udelar)

- Verified Haskell programs using `LiquidHaskell` refinement types.
- Proved structural invariants, complexity bounds, and safety properties.
- Compared expressiveness and tradeoffs between `LiquidHaskell` and `Why3`.
- Co-authored and presented at `VSTTE 2025`.
